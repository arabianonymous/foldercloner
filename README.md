# Folder Cloner for Windows In Python 3.11+

Clone big folders without the doubling the space they take on your drives! Uses Hard Links provided by the Windows CMD command `mklink` with the `/h` switch.

I personally made this to use it with big games when I want to modify them for singleplayer/ always-offline use to isolate the modded game from the online game, without having to fill my poor HDD.

Enjoy!
